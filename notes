MVP: full screen text editor that can save a file, along the lines of Notepad


Need full prompt_toolkit.layout.{Vsplit,Hsplit,Window} constructors.

Need text wrapping on the DEFAULT_BUFFER (or any buffer).
	This is taken care of by the Window instance; there is a parameter `wrap_lines`
	that accepts a bool.

How can I specify a different buffer?  Are there any advantages?  Is there added difficulty?

Need details on the loop - how can I customize it? What does the shortcut function provide?

Need to be able to add newlines.
	This can be done using a key binding for the enter key.  See `app.py`
